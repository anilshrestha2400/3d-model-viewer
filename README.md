The Model Viewer is a web-based 3D viewer built with React that lets users view and interact with a 3D model. It automatically adjusts the camera to fit the model and includes lighting to make the model visible. Users can rotate the model using simple controls, and there is a button to reset the camera view to its original position. This viewer is easy to use and allows for a smooth, interactive experience when viewing 3D models in the browser.
